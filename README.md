## 🎮 **The Game: Engkanto**

> A 2D action-adventure metroidvania, reimagined through the lens of Filipino myth and mystery.

**Engkanto** is inspired by the atmospheric worlds of *Hollow Knight* and *Hollow Knight: Silksong*, now woven into a setting rich with Philippine folklore. Explore a dark, mysterious realm teeming with creatures from local mythology — where exploration, combat, and storytelling merge into a deeply immersive experience.

### 🌿 **The Story**

You play as **Raya**, a young girl who awakens in an unfamiliar spirit-world filled with gods, monsters, and enigmatic beings. Armed only with her **arnis** (traditional Filipino fighting sticks), she must journey through diverse, haunting regions, uncover the land's secrets, and find her way back to the real world.

Along the way, Raya meets characters who speak in various Filipino dialects, each offering fragments of lore, guidance, and challenges. The game blends **fast-paced combat**, **intricate exploration**, and **emotional storytelling**, inviting you to uncover the truth behind Raya's arrival and the hidden history of the Engkanto realm itself.
